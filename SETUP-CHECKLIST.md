- [ ] Install Certbot for SSL: `sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx`

### 2.2 Clone & Build
```bash
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/wesleybhansen/open-mercato.git crm

cp apps/mercato/.env.production.example apps/mercato/.env
# Edit .env with all your API keys and secrets
nano apps/mercato/.env

  -e POSTGRES_DB=crm \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -v crm-pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  pgvector/pgvector:pg17-trixie

# If Postgres is already running (shared with LaunchBot):
sudo -u postgres createuser crm
sudo -u postgres createdb crm -O crm
sudo -u postgres psql -c "ALTER USER crm WITH PASSWORD 'YOUR_STRONG_PASSWORD';"
```

### 2.4 Build & Initialize
```bash
corepack enable
yarn install
yarn build:packages
yarn generate
yarn build
yarn initialize  # Seeds database, creates admin user
```

### 2.5 Run Database Migrations for Custom Modules

```
Note: We need to create a setup-tables.sql file with all our custom table creations.

### 2.6 Nginx Configuration
```nginx
server {
    server_name crm.yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;

        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_read_timeout 300s;
    }
}
```

### 2.7 SSL Certificate
```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d crm.yourdomain.com

pm2 save
pm2 startup

# Or using Docker:
docker-compose -f docker-compose.fullapp.yml up -d
```
