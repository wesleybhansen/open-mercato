# CRM Build Queue

Comprehensive prioritized queue. Updated 2026-04-02.

---

## TOP PRIORITY

### A. Login / Signup Flow Redesign
Redesign login, signup, and password reset screens with branding. Remove tenant URL requirement (auto-detect from email or show picker). Add forgot password flow with email reset link. "Sign in" link on signup, "Create account" on login. Mobile-friendly. Dev mode: auto-verify email on signup. This is the first impression — it needs to look professional, not like boilerplate.

### B. AI Voice Assistant (Scout V2)
Expand the Scout AI assistant into a full voice-to-voice CRM control system. Users can manage their entire CRM through voice or text chat — add contacts, send messages, check reports, create deals, manage pipeline, send emails, create landing pages, check analytics, etc. The AI assistant does real work, not just answers questions.

**Key capabilities:**
- Voice-to-voice chat (browser SpeechRecognition API for input, TTS for output)
- Text chat (existing Scout, upgraded)
- Full CRM action execution: create/update/delete contacts, deals, tasks, notes, tags
- Send emails, create landing pages, manage funnels, check reports
- Natural language queries: "What deals are closing this week?", "Show me my hottest leads"
- Confirmation step before executing destructive/important actions
- Context-aware: knows what page the user is on, who they're looking at

### C. Full CRM API + MCP Server
Build a comprehensive REST API and MCP (Model Context Protocol) server so the CRM can be controlled by external AI agents (LaunchBot, custom agents, etc.).

**REST API:**
- Complete CRUD for all entities (contacts, deals, tasks, notes, tags, invoices, products, etc.)
- API key authentication (already exists, needs full endpoint coverage)
- Webhook subscriptions for real-time events
- OpenAPI spec auto-generated from routes
- Rate limiting per API key

**MCP Server:**
- Expose CRM capabilities as MCP tools
- Tools: search_contacts, create_contact, update_deal, send_email, get_pipeline, create_task, etc.
- Connectable from any MCP-compatible AI agent
- Authentication via API key or session token

### D. Blog-Ops Integration
Connect the CRM to the Automated Marketing System at `~/Desktop/blog-ops`. Blog-Ops handles content generation, email sequence creation, competitive intelligence, and paid ads. The CRM handles contacts, pipeline, and delivery.

**Integration points:**
- Contact sync (bidirectional) — new CRM contacts pushed to Blog-Ops, Blog-Ops lead data pulled into CRM
- Email sequence content import — Blog-Ops generates sequence copy, CRM imports and sends via connected email
- Content pipeline — Blog-Ops generates content, CRM surfaces it for review/approval
- Lead magnet delivery — Blog-Ops creates lead magnets (PDFs, etc.), CRM handles the funnel + form + delivery
- Campaign orchestration — Blog-Ops plans campaigns, CRM executes (emails, landing pages, funnels)
- Shared API key auth between systems

### E. Smarter Landing Pages
Upgrade the landing page system to be more intelligent and produce higher-converting pages:
- AI analyzes the user's business, audience, and offer to generate truly custom copy (not template-fill)
- Competitor analysis — AI researches competitor landing pages and incorporates winning patterns
- Conversion optimization suggestions — AI reviews draft pages and suggests improvements
- A/B testing built in — create variants, split traffic, auto-select winner
- Dynamic personalization — pages adapt based on visitor data (UTM source, location, returning vs new)
- More page types: case study pages, comparison pages, webinar registration, application/waitlist pages
- Better mobile rendering and faster page load times
- Analytics dashboard per page: traffic sources, scroll depth, form abandonment, time on page

## ~~Bugs~~ ✅ All Fixed

1. ~~Stripe payment success page~~ — Branded confirmation with amount, invoice number, business name
2. ~~Reminder notifications~~ — Fixed email lookup + only marks sent when delivery succeeds
3. ~~Dashboard "Follow up" button~~ — Now pre-fills contact name in email compose

## Build Queue

### 4. Advanced Mode Audit
Go through the advanced settings and pages inherited from the Open Mercato fork. Verify what still works, what's broken, and what should be removed or simplified. The advanced mode (toggled in settings) exposes the full Open Mercato admin: users/roles management, system config, API keys, entity designer, query indexes, feature toggles, workflow builder, audit logs, etc. Audit each section — fix critical breakage, remove irrelevant enterprise features, ensure the toggle between simple/advanced mode works cleanly. This is about making the advanced mode a usable power-user experience, not a graveyard of broken framework pages.

**Key capabilities:**
- Voice-to-voice chat (browser SpeechRecognition API for input, Web Speech API / TTS for output)

### 22. Deploy to Hetzner
Docker compose for CRM + PostgreSQL + Redis. Nginx reverse proxy + SSL. Set APP_URL. Run setup-tables.sql. Switch Stripe to live keys. Update OAuth redirect URIs.

### 23. End-to-End Testing
Full flow: signup → onboarding → connect Gmail → send email → landing page → form → contact → Stripe → payment → sequence → verify.

### 23b. Post-Deploy Verification
After Hetzner deploy is live, verify these work in production:
- **Cron jobs**: Set up crontab for `/api/reminders/process` (every 1 min) and `/api/email-intelligence/cron` (every 30 min) and `/api/sequences/process` (every 5 min) and `/api/automation-rules/run-scheduled` (every 10 min). Verify reminders arrive without browser open.
- **Gmail OAuth**: Reconnect Gmail with production redirect URI. Verify token refresh works. Move Google Cloud project from Testing → Production so tokens don't expire after 7 days.
- **Email delivery**: Send test email via Scout. Verify Gmail sends (not just Resend fallback). Verify sender name shows correctly.
- **Stripe**: Switch to live keys. Test a real payment through a funnel or invoice. Verify success page shows correctly.

## LOW PRIORITY

### Scout Edit/Delete by Name
The AI voice assistant can create things reliably but struggles to edit/delete existing items by name. The AI either passes the wrong field name, sends `undefined`, or refuses to use the tool. Root cause: OpenAI Realtime API function calling doesn't reliably map spoken entity references to the correct tool parameters. Needs deeper investigation — possibly a two-step approach where the AI first calls a "find item" tool, then uses the returned ID to call the edit/delete tool. All the handler code and resolvers are already in place; the issue is purely on the AI tool-calling side.
