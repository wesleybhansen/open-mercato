# SPEC-066: GTM Engineer durable domain, execution, and provider contracts

**Date:** 2026-07-23 PDT
**Status:** Tranche 0 contract freeze. Documentation only. No entity, migration, route, provider call, deployment, or outreach is authorized by this spec. Implementation begins at Tranche 2+ of the authoritative build plan.
**Authority:** `~/dev/Noli AI/Software Strategy/gtm-engineer-build-plan-2026-07-23.md`. Companion: noli-platform `docs/specs/GTM-SPEC-01-2026-07-23-audience-plays-and-noli-core-credit-contracts.md` (Audience Plays engine, canonical noli-core credit ledger, Launchpad boundary).
**Launch classification:** optional-parallel, feature-flagged, OFF for the current Noli launch candidate.
**Spec numbering note:** SPEC-065 exists only on the paused `agent/gdpr-completion-contract` branch (documentation checkpoint `1596314f5`); this spec deliberately takes 066 so the two branches reconcile without collision.

## 1. TLDR

CRM gains a new app-level `gtm` module owning ALL durable GTM Engineer state: workspaces, ICP/voice versions, plays, research runs, candidates, evidence, contact points, campaigns, immutable approval versions, enrollments, steps, rendered messages, send attempts, replies, suppression, provider-operation shadows, and audit events. It reuses ONLY the qualified mailbox transports (`email_connections` + `email-router`) behind a new durability layer. The legacy sequence/automation processors are explicitly not reused or extended. noli-core is the sole canonical pooled-credit ledger; the CRM stores a correlation shadow keyed to the noli-core operation id. Both correlated email replies and user-recorded social replies atomically stop all remaining mixed-channel steps. V1 is US B2B only and fails closed everywhere before paid sourcing, promotion, approval, or launch.

## 2. Problem statement

The build plan requires guarded, durable, approval-gated outbound email plus manual social tasks. The existing CRM machinery cannot provide this (evidence in §3): the sequence engine has claim-without-lease execution, fire-and-forget sends recorded as executed regardless of outcome, race-prone enrollment, and no suppression gate; reply correlation to a specific outbound send does not exist; suppression is a flat Resend-webhook-fed list enforced only in the campaign blast path; and there is no reservation/idempotency primitive for paid provider spend.

## 3. Code-grounded baseline (verified 2026-07-23)

### 3.1 Qualified transports (REUSE, behind the new durability layer)

- **`EmailConnection` -> `email_connections`** (`apps/mercato/src/modules/email/data/schema.ts:424-497`): uuid PK; `tenant_id`, `organization_id`, `user_id` (per-user mailbox); `provider` free-form text, router switches on `'gmail' | 'microsoft' | 'smtp'` (`email-router.ts:76`); SMTP/IMAP app-password fields (`smtp_pass` shared with IMAP per comment at :468); `purpose` null = personal inbox, `'customer_service'` = CS desk; `is_primary`, `is_active`, `deleted_at`. **No health/error/last-sync columns on the connection**; sync health lives on `email_intelligence_settings` (:687-742).
- **`EspConnection` -> `esp_connections`** (schema.ts:499-541) with `api_key` **plaintext (known security gap flagged in-code at :514-517)**.
- **Send orchestrator `email/lib/email-router.ts`**: `sendEmailByPurpose(knex, orgId, tenantId, purpose, params)` (:312-392) resolves provider and dispatches Gmail/Outlook/SMTP/ESP; returns `{ ok, messageId?, sentVia?, fromAddress?, error? }`; never throws; **writes no durable send row** (persistence is the caller's job). `sendViaSMTP` (`smtp-service.ts:20-51`) and `sendViaESP` (`esp-service.ts:14-34`) return provider message-id only - **no delivery receipt**. Delivery/bounce/complaint feedback exists **only for Resend** via the Svix-verified webhook (`email/api/webhook/route.ts:15-34`), not for Gmail/Outlook/SMTP sends.
- A second, org-agnostic Resend stack exists (`email/services/email-sender.ts`, global env keys). The GTM layer standardizes on the router + `email_connections`/`esp_connections`; `email-sender.ts` is not a GTM transport.

### 3.2 Legacy sequence/automation engine (DO NOT REUSE OR EXTEND - evidence)

- Tables `sequences, sequence_steps, sequence_enrollments, sequence_step_executions, automation_rules, automation_scheduled_steps, automation_rule_logs` are **raw-knex with no ORM entity and no in-repo migration** (`modules/sequences/data/` is empty; no `migrations/` dir); schema is not authoritative in the repo.
- Enrollment (`sequences/api/[id]/enroll/route.ts:40-90`): duplicate-enroll check is SELECT-then-INSERT with no unique constraint - race-prone.
- Processor (`sequences/api/process/route.ts`): cron-poll (`SEQUENCE_PROCESS_SECRET`, :38), claims via `UPDATE ... WHERE status='scheduled' SET status='processing'` (:73-76) but has **no lease/timeout/heartbeat** - a crashed `processing` row is stuck forever, never re-selected, no `attempts`, no reclaim. Sends insert `email_messages` `status='queued'` (:194-207), call `sendEmailByPurpose` best-effort, `console.error` on failure (:216-221), and **mark the execution `executed` regardless** (:223-227); the queued row is never updated and never retried - success and failure are indistinguishable. **No suppression/unsubscribe/preference check** before sending.
- `automation-execute.ts` header: "Called fire-and-forget from various routes" (:15); `processScheduledSteps` (:588-641) repeats the same claim-without-lease pattern.

### 3.3 Reply/threading reality

- Inbound mail dedupe key is `email_messages.metadata->>'provider_message_id'` - a JSONB lookup with **no unique index** (`inbox-ingest.ts:154-158`, `personal-inbox-sync.ts:112-116`).
- Threading is a header-derived `thread_id` string (`threadRef = refList[0] || inReplyTo || rawMessageId`, `imap-service.ts:227-228`); `email_messages.thread_id` is text, not an FK; there is no threads table. **No linkage exists from an inbound reply to a specific outbound send row** - campaign/sequence reply correlation is unimplemented today.

### 3.4 Suppression reality

- `EmailUnsubscribe` -> `email_unsubscribes` (schema.ts:261-281): flat org-scoped list; the ORM entity lacks the `reason` column the webhook writes (route.ts:88,141) - a raw legacy column. `customer_entities.email_status` is likewise a raw column absent from the ORM entity.
- Enforcement exists **only in the campaign blast path** (`campaigns-send/route.ts:62-88`); sequence and automation sends check nothing.
- Outbound **RFC 8058 one-click `List-Unsubscribe`/`List-Unsubscribe-Post` headers are not implemented** (the header is only read on inbound for bulk detection, `imap-service.ts:42-54`). Unsubscribe links use a signed HMAC preference-center token (`unsubscribe/[contactId]/route.ts:9-26`).

### 3.5 Contacts

- `CustomerEntity` -> `customer_entities` (`packages/core/src/modules/customers/data/entities.ts:17-134`), person/company via `kind`; `primary_email` nullable with **no unique constraint** - dedupe is lowercase match in application code (`inbox-ingest.ts:69-75`). Two parallel timeline stores exist: ORM `customer_activities` (:370-418) and raw `contact_timeline_events` (via `apps/mercato/src/lib/timeline.ts`).

### 3.6 Internal endpoint + identity pattern (reference for all new GTM internal routes)

`integrations_api/api/internal/provision-key/route.ts`: `metadata = { path, POST: { requireAuth: false } }` (:17-20); length-guarded `crypto.timingSafeEqual` against `Bearer ${NOLI_INTERNAL_SERVICE_SECRET}` (:23-33); `findNoliUserById(noliUserId)` -> `resolveClerkUserToAuthContext(clerk_user_id)` which gates on the `crm` entitlement and yields `{ userId, orgId, tenantId }` (:47-67). Every GTM internal route mirrors this exactly and self-scopes every query by `organization_id` + `tenant_id`.

### 3.7 Module conventions binding this spec

Per root `AGENTS.md` + `packages/core/AGENTS.md` + `packages/cli/AGENTS.md`: new module at `apps/mercato/src/modules/gtm/` with `data/entities.ts`; migrations generated by `yarn db:generate` into the module's `migrations/` (never hand-written; keep the snapshot in sync); tables plural snake_case with module prefix, uuid PKs, `organization_id` + `tenant_id` NOT NULL, `created_at`/`updated_at`, `deleted_at` for soft delete; CRUD via `makeCrudRoute` with `indexer`, writes via the Command pattern, `openApi` exports, ACL features `gtm.*` in `acl.ts` mirrored in `setup.ts`; no new raw-knex routes under `apps/mercato/src/app/api/`; registry is baked at build time; production migrations are applied manually by idempotent psql as a separately authorized step.

## 4. New module `gtm`: durable entity catalog (Tranche 2 generation target)

All tables: uuid PK `id`, `organization_id uuid NOT NULL`, `tenant_id uuid NOT NULL`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at` (soft delete), composite index `(organization_id, tenant_id, ...)`. Names frozen now; column lists are the implementation baseline (additive drift allowed at generation time, subtractive drift is a spec change).

| `GtmCampaign` | `gtm_campaigns` | `workspace_id FK`, `play_id FK`, `name`, `status(draft\|in_review\|approved\|launching\|active\|paused\|stopped\|completed)`, `current_version_id FK null`, `channel_mix jsonb`, `settings jsonb (daily cap, send window, timezone, jitter)` |
| `GtmCampaignVersion` | `gtm_campaign_versions` | `campaign_id FK`, `version int` (**unique `(campaign_id, version)`**), `snapshot jsonb` (full recipient/step/schedule/exclusion/sender/cap/projected-credit freeze), `content_hash text` (SHA-256 of canonical snapshot), `approved_by_user_id`, `approved_at`, `invalidated_at null`, `invalidated_reason`; **immutable after approval** |
| `GtmEnrollment` | `gtm_enrollments` | `campaign_id FK`, `campaign_version_id FK`, `candidate_id FK`, `contact_id uuid null`, `status(active\|stopped\|completed)`, `stop_reason(email_reply\|social_reply\|unsubscribe\|bounce\|complaint\|manual\|campaign_stopped) null`, `stopped_at`; **unique `(campaign_id, candidate_id)`** |

| `GtmRenderedMessage` | `gtm_rendered_messages` | `campaign_version_id FK`, `enrollment_id FK`, `step_id FK`, `subject`, `body_html`, `body_text`, `content_hash`, `edited_by_user_id null`; **frozen at approval; unique `(enrollment_id, step_id)`** |
| `GtmSendAttempt` | `gtm_send_attempts` | `enrollment_id FK`, `step_id FK`, `rendered_message_id FK`, `campaign_version_id FK`, `mailbox_connection_id uuid -> email_connections.id`, `state` (§6 machine), `claim_token uuid null`, `claim_expires_at timestamptz null`, `fence int`, `attempt_no int`, `idempotency_key text` (**unique `(organization_id, idempotency_key)`**), `provider_message_id`, `rfc_message_id text` (our generated Message-ID), `provider_receipt jsonb`, `ambiguous_at`, `scheduled_for`, `sent_at`, terminal timestamps |
| `GtmReply` | `gtm_replies` | `enrollment_id FK`, `send_attempt_id FK null` (email) , `step_id FK null` (social, user-recorded), `channel`, `direction(inbound)`, `email_message_id uuid null -> email_messages.id`, `classification(interested\|neutral_question\|not_now\|referral\|unsubscribe\|wrong_person\|negative)`, `classification_source(model\|user_override)`, `draft_response jsonb`, `draft_status(none\|drafted\|approved\|sent)` |

| `GtmAuditEvent` | `gtm_audit_events` | `actor(user_id\|system\|agent)`, `action`, `object_type`, `object_id`, `object_version`, `request_id`, `metadata jsonb` (redacted) |

Retention: `gtm_candidates.retention_expires_at` defaults to 90 days for never-promoted candidates (product-confirmable; open question); a sweep job hard-deletes expired candidates + their evidence/contact points and writes an audit event. Rejected candidates never become CRM contacts (`promoted_contact_id` stays null).

## 5. Identity, tenancy, RBAC

- Internal routes (hub proxy targets) all follow §3.6: `/internal/gtm/import-audience-play`, `/internal/gtm/workspace`, `/internal/gtm/plays`, `/internal/gtm/research-runs`, `/internal/gtm/candidates`, `/internal/gtm/campaigns`, `/internal/gtm/approvals`, `/internal/gtm/inbox`, `/internal/gtm/senders`, `/internal/gtm/suppressions`, `/internal/gtm/usage`, `/internal/gtm/tasks` (manual social). Exact list finalized in Tranche 2; every route re-resolves `noliUserId -> {userId, orgId, tenantId}` and self-scopes.
- ACL features: `gtm.view`, `gtm.edit`, `gtm.approve`, `gtm.launch` (approve and launch are distinct); declared in `acl.ts`, defaults in `setup.ts`. Server-to-server callers carry the resolved user's roles (provision-key precedent §3.6).
- The GTM feature is additionally gated on the `crm` entitlement plus `features.gtm === true` (GTM-SPEC-01 §6); flag-off = fail-closed at the dispatcher-facing routes.

## 6. Email execution state machine (frozen)

States: `planned -> rendered -> reviewed -> approved -> claimed -> provider_started -> accepted | failed | ambiguous`, then post-send transitions `accepted -> delivered | bounced | complained | replied` where transport feedback exists (Resend webhook; Gmail/Outlook/SMTP sends stay `accepted` unless a correlated bounce message arrives).

Rules (each is a test target in §12):

1. **Claim = CAS with lease and fence.** A worker claims a due attempt with `UPDATE ... WHERE state='approved' AND scheduled_for <= now() AND (claim_expires_at IS NULL OR claim_expires_at < now()) SET state='claimed', claim_token=gen_random_uuid(), claim_expires_at = now() + lease, fence = fence + 1` using **database time only**. Every subsequent write for that attempt must present the claim token and current fence (SPEC-065 lesson: DB-time CAS + fencing, no application clocks).
2. **Pre-send recheck inside the claim, immediately before provider contact:** current suppression (§8), recipient eligibility + `execution_eligibility` of the play (§7), campaign `current_version_id` equals the attempt's `campaign_version_id` and that version is approved and not invalidated, enrollment still `active`, sender connection `is_active` and healthy, daily cap headroom for the mailbox (counted from `gtm_send_attempts` in the current send window), and exact org/tenant identity. Any failure -> `failed` with reason, never silent skip.
3. **Provider contact:** transition `claimed -> provider_started` is durably written BEFORE the SMTP/API call. Our own RFC `Message-ID` is generated and persisted first (`rfc_message_id`) and set on the outgoing message so replies correlate (§9).
4. **Outcome:** provider success -> `accepted` with `provider_message_id` + receipt. A thrown/failed call -> `failed` (retryable only from `failed` with a NEW attempt row and the same idempotency scope rules). **A timeout/unknown outcome after `provider_started` -> `ambiguous`: never automatically retried**, parked for reconciliation (at-most-one provider attempt per rendered message while ambiguous). A provider exception can never mark the attempt executed (the legacy engine's exact defect, §3.2).
5. **Stuck-claim recovery:** a lease-expired `claimed` row (crash before `provider_started`) is reclaimable by CAS with fence increment. A lease-expired `provider_started` row is NOT reclaimable - it degrades to `ambiguous`.
6. **Scheduling** uses DB-time due queries over `gtm_send_attempts` (no external cron dependency for correctness; the trigger cadence may be cron, but every operation is safe under overlap, replay, and delay). Send windows are timezone-aware with jitter, all computed at claim time.

## 7. US-B2B scope enforcement (fail-closed ladder, frozen)

`execution_eligibility` is evaluated server-side and re-evaluated at EVERY money- or contact-adjacent boundary; a non-`executable` play fails closed at each of:

1. research-run pricing/creation (before any reserve);
2. provider reserve (the noli-core RPC call is never issued for non-executable plays);
3. candidate promotion to prospect/contact;
4. campaign attach and approval freeze (an approval snapshot embeds the eligibility evaluation; a play edit that changes geography/market invalidates dependent research-run plans and campaign versions - `invalidated_reason='scope_change'`);
5. launch;
6. every send claim (§6 rule 2).

Direct API calls, raw IDs, retries, agent prompts, and previously approved versions cannot bypass this: the check binds to the play row's current computed state, not to caller input. Non-US, B2C, mixed, housing-consumer, and ambiguous plays remain viewable as `strategy_only` and can never reach a reserve call or an approval snapshot.

## 8. Suppression and compliance (frozen)

- `gtm_suppressions` is the GTM enforcement table; writes flow in from: GTM unsubscribe events, hard bounces, complaints, manual suppression, duplicate protection, and a one-way import of existing `email_unsubscribes` rows at campaign build time (the legacy list keeps its own semantics; GTM never writes back).
- Enforcement points: candidate qualification (annotate), rendering (exclude), approval snapshot (excluded list frozen and visible), claim-time recheck (§6 rule 2 - the race-closing check), and reply-classification `unsubscribe` (stop + suppress atomically).
- GTM outbound email REQUIRES: accurate sender identity/subject, the org's configured physical postal address, a working unsubscribe link, and **RFC 8058 one-click `List-Unsubscribe` + `List-Unsubscribe-Post` headers (net-new; §3.4)**. The unsubscribe token is a signed HMAC token (existing `signEmailToken` precedent) hitting a GTM endpoint that writes `gtm_suppressions` + stops enrollments atomically.
- Duplicate protection: an address (hash) active in any other GTM campaign of the org cannot be enrolled without explicit override (`reason='duplicate'` suppression consulted at build + approval + claim).
- Resend is not a GTM cold-outreach transport (build plan §9.2); GTM sends go through user-connected mailboxes/ESP per §3.1.

## 9. Reply correlation and atomic stop (frozen)

- Correlation is net-new (§3.3): inbound ingestion gains a GTM hook that matches `In-Reply-To`/`References` header values against `gtm_send_attempts.rfc_message_id` (indexed). Fallback match: same mailbox + same counterparty address + thread ref of a GTM send. A match creates `GtmReply` linked to the enrollment and send attempt.
- **Atomic stop:** in ONE transaction: set `gtm_enrollments.status='stopped'`, `stop_reason`, `stopped_at`; cancel every remaining non-terminal `gtm_send_attempts` row of the enrollment (`approved/planned -> failed(reason='stopped')`, claimed rows are fenced out at their next write); mark pending manual steps cancelled; THEN commit the reply row in the same transaction. The reply is never surfaced before the stop state is durable.
- **User-recorded social replies take the identical transaction path** (a manual-task "mark replied" action), satisfying the non-negotiable that both reply kinds atomically stop all remaining mixed-channel steps.
- Classification into `interested|neutral_question|not_now|referral|unsubscribe|wrong_person|negative` runs after commit; `unsubscribe` additionally writes `gtm_suppressions`. Response drafting produces `draft_response` requiring explicit user approval before any send (which is itself a new `gtm_send_attempts` row through the full machine).

## 10. Mixed-channel manual tasks (frozen)

- `mode='manual_social'` steps surface the exact approved message + direct profile URL; the user marks `sent`, `skipped`, or `replied` (user-recorded state only; the UI never implies synchronization).
- LinkedIn connect-first: step A `send_connection_request` (user-recorded `requested`/`accepted`), step B with `depends_on_step_id=A, dependency_kind='linkedin_connection_accepted'` stays locked until A is `accepted` or an explicit user override is recorded (`gtm_audit_events` row). No browser automation, no Zernio involvement (Zernio provides no LinkedIn DM/connect capability and is unqualified for GTM in V1).
- Manual steps live on the same campaign timeline and the same enrollment stop semantics (§9).

## 11. Provider adapter capability contracts and fixtures (Tranche 0/3 design, frozen shape)

### 11.1 Capability contract

Every adapter (source, enrichment, verification, sending) declares a static descriptor consumed by planning/pricing and enforced at run time:

```
{
  adapter_id, layer: source|enrich|verify|send,
  capabilities: [{ signal_kind, entity_units, geographies, channels }],
  constraints: { license: { export, customer_display, outreach_allowed }, rate_limits, max_batch },
  cost_model: { unit, quoted_credits_per_unit, pay_on_found: bool },
  ambiguity_contract: { timeout_is_ambiguous: bool, receipt_fields: [...] },
  dsr: { deletion_supported: bool }
}
```

A requested signal with no covering capability **fails closed at plan time** ("unsupported dimension" shown before any spend); a contract-disabled capability cannot run even by direct call (checked again inside the adapter invoke path).

### 11.2 Adapter invocation rule (credit-coupled)

Adapter invoke is wrapped: (1) noli-core `provider_op_reserve` (org-scoped idempotency key = `research_run_id + adapter_id + batch fingerprint`); (2) shadow row `gtm_provider_operations` with the returned canonical id; (3) `provider_op_start`; (4) provider call; (5) `provider_op_settle` with charged units + receipt, or `provider_op_mark_ambiguous` on unknown outcome (never a replacement operation, never a local charge inference). Webhook/delayed completions look up the shadow by `noli_core_operation_id` and settle the SAME operation. Full RPC contract: GTM-SPEC-01 §4.

### 11.3 Deterministic fixtures

- A `fixture` adapter implements every layer from versioned JSON fixture files (checked into the `gtm` module test tree in Tranche 2+): seeded, deterministic, replayable; each fixture row carries the same receipt/ambiguity fields a real provider would return, including crafted `timeout`, `partial`, `no_result`, `invalid_schema`, `rate_limit`, `5xx`, `delayed_completion`, `webhook_replay`, and `ambiguous_acceptance` cases so every §12 test runs with zero provider calls.
- Fixture identities are synthetic or Noli-owned only; no real prospect data enters fixtures.

### 11.4 Capped benchmark protocol (bake-off; execution separately authorized)

100-200 synthetic/owned/internal test targets across the five cohorts (local B2B services; professional services; B2B SaaS; ecommerce suppliers; solo consultants selling B2B). Candidates: `Crustdata + DataForSEO` (recommended default), Apollo-reseller alternative, Bright Data broad-source alternative; FullEnrich only on rows where the primary source fails to yield an acceptable verified contact. Measured per build plan §6.4 (precision after human review, coverage/freshness, provenance quality, verified-email yield, false-match/dupe rate, latency + failure/ambiguity behavior, cost per qualified/contactable prospect, DSR support, OEM/display/export rights). Hard caps: per-provider spend ceiling agreed before the run, batch sizes <= 25, kill switch, no outreach of any kind, and every operation through the §11.2 reserve path. Output: written decision matrix appended to the build plan (via the progress-doc amendment process, not by editing the plan mid-tranche).

## 12. Acceptance tests (focused; implemented alongside their tranches)

Identity/tenancy: wrong user/org/tenant/campaign/sender/provider-account IDs rejected on every internal route; raw IDs and agent prompts cannot cross tenants; `gtm.approve` vs `gtm.launch` role separation enforced; server-to-server calls re-resolve identity (never trust caller-supplied ownership).

Scope: the §7 ladder - each of the six boundaries independently blocks a `strategy_only` play including via direct API, retry, and a previously-approved-then-invalidated version; geography/market edit invalidates plans + versions before any provider or sender contact.

Approval/invalidation: no send without an exact current approved version (`content_hash` verified at claim); any edit/regenerate/exclude/reorder invalidates the prior version; double-approve is idempotent; approving a stale draft (concurrent edit) fails.

Credits: reserve idempotency under concurrency; insufficient-credit fail-closed BEFORE provider contact; exactly-once settle under double-settle/webhook replay; ambiguous parks and never auto-retries; delayed settle lands on the original operation; shadow row can never mutate a balance (no write path exists).

Send machine: double-click launch, concurrent workers claiming the same attempt (one wins by CAS), crash after `provider_started` (-> ambiguous, no duplicate send), crash after accepted (receipt preserved), delayed writer fenced out after lease expiry, stuck-claim reclaim before provider contact, daily-cap boundary, send-window boundary.

Replies/races: email reply racing a scheduled send (stop wins; claimed attempt fenced); user-recorded social reply racing a send (same); unsubscribe racing a send; reply arriving for an already-stopped enrollment (idempotent); classification override; drafted response cannot send without approval.

Suppression: one-click header present on every GTM send; unsubscribe token tamper rejected; suppression added mid-campaign blocks at claim; duplicate-across-campaigns protection; legacy `email_unsubscribes` import respected.

Candidates: dedupe-key uniqueness under concurrent sourcing; rejected candidates never promoted; retention sweep deletes only expired never-promoted candidates and audits the deletion.

## 13. Cross-app boundaries owned elsewhere (pointers)

- Audience Plays import: hub calls `/internal/gtm/import-audience-play`; contract in GTM-SPEC-01 §3.1(6).
- Knowledge mirror: KB has **no document lock primitive** (verified net-new); lock semantics therefore live HERE - `gtm_icp_versions`/`gtm_voice_versions` immutable+locked rows are canonical, and KB receives read-only mirror notes via the existing `pkb_` agent-documents API tagged `source='gtm'`. A KB-side lock is not required for V1 and is not assumed.
- AMS assets: request/attach contract in blog-ops `docs/gtm-asset-handoff-contract-2026-07-23.md`; GTM stores only asset references, never regenerates AMS capability.
- COS orchestration: hermes-cos-control `docs/gtm-cos-orchestration-contract-2026-07-23.md`; the agent proposes, humans approve - the COS carries no capability to bypass §6/§7/§8 (it acts through the same internal routes with the same gates, mirroring the `cos_approvals` pending->approved->execute pattern in `apps/hub/src/lib/cos/approvals.ts`).

## 14. Later-tranche inventory for the CRM (identified now, NOT created in Tranche 0)

Migration application to production remains a separately authorized manual psql step per repo convention; nothing in this spec authorizes it.

## 15. Risks and impact review

- **Plaintext mailbox/ESP credentials (§3.1)** predate GTM; GTM increases their blast radius. Mitigation queued as a cross-cutting hardening item (progress doc); GTM does not add new plaintext secret columns.
- **Registry/migration operational risk:** new module routes do not exist until a no-cache rebuild; migrations are manual. Both are existing repo invariants; every GTM tranche exit includes registry + schema verification.
- **Ambiguous-outcome inventory growth:** `ambiguous`/`reconciliation_required` rows require an operator surface (Usage/admin) - included in Tranche 6 scope; no automatic expiry, mirroring the OpenCode ambiguous-lease decision.
- **Residual:** reply correlation via headers is best-effort against mail clients that strip References; fallback matching (§9) narrows but cannot eliminate misses - accepted for V1 and surfaced honestly in the inbox.

## 16. Changelog
