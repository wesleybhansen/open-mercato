/*
 * Internal prospect-removal endpoint (privacy policy section 3.8).
 *
 * The Noli hub's public /api/public/prospect-removal route calls this
 * server-to-server with NOLI_INTERNAL_SERVICE_SECRET after it has done the
 * CORS / honeypot / rate-limit work. There is no session and no user: the
 * requester is a member of the public asking to be removed from Prospect
 * Data, so this route deliberately writes ACROSS every organization (a
 * platform-wide suppression plus a stop of anything already queued). That is
 * the one intentional exception to the module's self-scoping rule, and it is
 * only reachable behind the shared secret.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT gated on the GTM feature flag: like the unsubscribe
 * endpoint, removal is a compliance surface. Once any address exists in
 * Prospect Data the removal path must keep working even if the feature is
 * later switched off.
 *
 * Public at the dispatcher level (requireAuth: false) - we authenticate with
 * the shared secret instead, mirroring api/internal/import-audience-play.
 *
 * PRIVACY-CRITICAL: the response is identical whether or not we held
 * anything for that address. Telling an anonymous caller "yes, you were in
 * someone's prospect list" would itself be a disclosure, and would turn this
 * endpoint into an oracle for probing who is being prospected. Counts of
 * stopped enrollments are returned only because the hub never forwards them
 * to the browser; the public route collapses them. Nothing here logs the
 * address.
